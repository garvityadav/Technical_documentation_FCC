                    <p class="h-secondary">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a
                        small
                        and lightweight
                        language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to
                        the
                        objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                    <p class="h-secondary">JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and
                        Math,
                        and a core set of
                        language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                        extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                    <ul>
                        <li class="h-secondary">Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to
                            control a browser and
                            its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to
                            place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                            and
                            page navigation.</li>
                        <li class="h-secondary">Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                            relevant to running
                            JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to
                            communicate
                            with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                            application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

                <article>

                    <p class="h-secondary">JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in
                        some
                        others. The
                        JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type
                        checking.
                        JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
                        constructs
                        which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                    <p class="h-secondary">In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations,
                        JavaScript supports a
                        runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                        values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based
                        object
                        model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can
                        vary
                        for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                        requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
                    <p class="h-secondary">JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to
                        declare all variables,
                        classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private,
                        or
                        protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function
                        return
                        types are not explicitly typed.</p>

                    <p class="h-secondary">You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names
                        of
                        variables, called
                        identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                    </p>
                    <p class="h-secondary">A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar
                        sign
                        ($);
                        subsequent
                        characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                        characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                    <p class="h-secondary">You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You
                        can
                        also use the Unicode
                        escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits,
                        temp99,
                        and

                    <p class="h-secondary">You can declare a variable in three ways:
                        With the keyword var. For example,</p>
                    <code class="h-tertiary code">var x = 42.</code>
                    <p class="h-secondary">This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
                    <p class="h-secondary">By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
                    <code class="h-tertiary code">x = 42.</code>
                    <p class="h-secondary">With the keyword let. For example,</p>
                    <code class="h-tertiary code">let y = 13.</code>
                    <p class="h-secondary">This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable
                        scope
                        below.

                <article>

                    <p class="h-secondary">When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global
                        variable,
                        because it is
                        available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a
                        function,
                        it
                        is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
                    <p class="h-secondary">JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
                        rather, a
                        variable declared within
                        a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example
                        the
                        following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within
                        which x
                        is
                        declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
                    <code class="h-tertiary code">if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                    <p class="h-secondary">This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
                        ECMAScript
                        2015.
                    </p>
                    <code class="h-tertiary code">if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not

                    <p class="h-secondary">Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages
                        the
                        global
                        object is window,
                        so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
                    <p class="h-secondary">Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame
                        from
                        another window or
                        frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
                        declared
                        in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>

                    <p class="h-secondary">You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax
                        of

                        constant identifier is
                        the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
                        and
                        can
                        contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>

                    <p class="h-secondary">A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the

                    <p class="h-secondary">The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope

                <article>

                    <p class="h-secondary">The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="h-secondary">Six data types that are primitives:
                            <ul>

                                <li class="h-secondary">Boolean. true and false.
                                </li>
                                <li class="h-secondary">null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                                    JavaScript is
                                    case-sensitive, null is
                                    not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                                <li class="h-secondary">undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                                <li class="h-secondary">Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                                <li class="h-secondary">String. "Howdy"</li>
                                <li class="h-secondary">Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
                                    unique and immutable.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="h-secondary">and Object</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="h-secondary">Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to
                        perform
                        useful functions with
                        your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You
                        can
                        think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your
                        application
                        can
                        perform.

                    <p class="h-secondary">Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true.
                        Use
                        the
                        optional else clause
                        to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>

            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">

                <header class="h-primary">while statement</header>
                <code class="h-tertiary code">if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
                <p class="h-secondary">condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for
                    an
                    explanation of what
                    evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                    statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested
                    if
                    statements.</p>
                <p class="h-secondary">You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions
                    tested
                    in sequence, as
                    follows:</p>
                <code class="h-tertiary code">if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
                            } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }</code>
                <p class="h-secondary">In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
                    evaluates
                    to true will be
                    executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
                    general,
                    it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:</p>
                <code class="h-tertiary code">if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                                    statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                                        statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                                        statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code>
                <p class="h-secondary">t is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because
                    the
                    assignment can be
                    confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
                </p>
                <code class="h-tertiary code">if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
                <p class="h-secondary">If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice
                    is to
                    put additional
                    parentheses around the assignment. For example:
                </p>
                <code class="h-tertiary code">if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

                    <p class="h-secondary">A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
                        statement)
                        consists of the
                        function keyword, followed by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="h-secondary">The name of the function.</li>
                        <li class="h-secondary">A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                            separated
                            by commas.</li>
                        <li class="h-secondary">The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
                            brackets, { }.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="h-secondary">For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
                    <code class="h-tertiary code">function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
                    <p class="h-secondary">The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists
                        of
                        one
                        statement that says
                        to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
                        statement
                        specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
                    <code class="h-tertiary code">return number * number;</code>
                    <p class="h-secondary">Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the
                        value
                        is passed to the
                        function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
                        globally
                        or in the calling function.
